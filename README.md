# TouchPiano
Use an ESP32 and some bananas to make a piano!

## What you will need:
- An ESP32 development module (I shamelessly recommend mine: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07R459KW5)
- Some bananas (I planned to use 5 in this example, but I got hungry and now I only have 4)
- Jumper wires
- Linux PC with python (I'm sure it's easy to make it work on Windows or Mac too!)
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 stuff installed (Good instructions for this can be found at https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/)
- 10 minutes to kill
